Aim is to create a top down game that uses ingestion of different metals to bypass challlenges. 
Lots of inspiration from mistborn.
Current thinking is:
  Need player controlled character
  limited amount of consumable metals
  challenges require effcient use of metals to overcome
  
metals to use:
  Iron = Pull (need objects for this to apply to)
  Steel = Push (+ coins as ammo) heavy ammo = more used but higher damage
  Tin = see more (should most of level be hard to see?) (sounds louder)
  Pewter = move faster (be stronger?)
  Copper = become harder to see (by enemies, lower radius of detection)
  bronze = able to see enemies easier
  Aluminium = remove reserves? not sure if needed
  Duralumin = enhance next metal used (possibly implement another wasy)
  
 metals omitted arent really relevant to game (emotions etc)
 
 need a range of 2D challenges, starter ones can be tutorials on the different metals
 
 need maps + interaction
 
 Need lots of images, (crack out paint and 8-bit art)
 
 2D top down, or 2d side view (terraria-esque) both?
  
 customisable loadout of metals pre-level (later implementation)
 different characters with strengths/ weaknesses
